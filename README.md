## Overview

The Product Preview Card Component challenge focused on building a visually appealing card component that effectively presents a product preview along with its essential information. The challenge required a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

Throughout the project, I strived to understand the design requirements and implemented a responsive layout using HTML and CSS. The objective was to create an attractive card component that captures the attention of users and communicates the key details of the product being featured.

The goal was to deliver a visually engaging card component that is both informative and visually appealing.
